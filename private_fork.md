 private_fork.md                                                                         
 The [repository](https://github.com/usi-systems/easytrace) for the assignment is public  and Github does not allow the creation of private forks for public repositories.
 
 The correct way of creating a private frok by duplicating the repo is documented         [here](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/).
 
 For this assignment the commands are:
 
  1. Create a bare clone of the repository.
     (This is temporary and will be removed so just do it wherever.)
     ```bash
     git clone --bare git@github.com:usi-systems/easytrace.git
     ```
 
  2. [Create a new private repository on Github](https://help.github.com/articles/        creating-a-new-repository/) and name it `easytrace`.
     > If you are unable to create a private repo, you can request unlimited private      repos as a studant by getting
     > the [student pack](https://education.github.com/pack) from Github.
 
  3. Mirror-push your bare clone to your new `easytrace` repository.
     > Replace `<your_username>` with your actual Github username in the url below.
 
     ```bash
     cd easytrace.git
     git push --mirror git@github.com:<your_username>/easytrace.git
     ```
 
  4. Remove the temporary local repository you created in step 1.
     ```bash
     cd ..
     rm -rf easytrace.git
     ```
 
  5. You can now clone your `easytrace` repository on your machine (in my case in the     `code` folder).
     ```bash
     cd ~/code
     git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/easytrace.git
     ```
 
  6. If you want, add the original repo as remote to fetch (potential) future changes.
     Make sure you also disable push on the remote (as you are not allowed to push to it  anyway).
     ```bash
     git remote add upstream git@github.com:usi-systems/easytrace.git
     git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE
     ```
     You can list all your remotes with `git remote -v`. You should see:
     ```
     origin  git@github.com:<your_username>/easytrace.git (fetch)
     origin  git@github.com:<your_username>/easytrace.git (push)
     upstream    git@github.com:usi-systems/easytrace.git (fetch)
     upstream    DISABLE (push)
     ```
     > When you push, do so on `origin` with `git push origin`.
 
     > When you want to pull changes from `upstream` you can just fetch the remote and    rebase on top of your work.
     ```bash
       git fetch upstream
       git rebase upstream/master
       ```
       And solve the conflicts if any
